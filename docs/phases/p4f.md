# P4f — self-service: the "me" API and application-initiated actions

The running record of what building the phase found. The argument is in
[the spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-11-p4f-self-service-design.md) and
[the plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-11-11-p4f-self-service.md).

## Spike results

Each spike of the plan is recorded here by the increment that runs it.

### S4: where access tokens are verified, and whether one verifier serves a second audience

`verifyTenantAccessToken` (`packages/protocol-admin/src/usecase/authenticate-admin.ts`)
takes `expected.audience` and `expected.issuers` as arguments and passes them to
`verifyJwt` with `typ: 'at+jwt'`; `apps/server/src/mcp-deps.ts` wires it as
`verifyAccessToken` for the MCP door, which passes the MCP URL. The same verifier
therefore serves the "me" audience with no change: `validateMeToken` passes the
tenant's "me" URL. The admin door and `/userinfo` verify with their own fixed
audience (the admin API's, the accepted issuers), so a token with only the "me"
audience already fails there; a token naming the "me" audience beside theirs
passed, and each of the three now refuses it by name (`namesMeAudience`, kernel).

### S2: the `acr` a session earns

`acrFor` (`packages/protocol-oidc/src/service/acr.ts`) returns `'2'` when the
authenticators that ran count at least two factors (a passkey counts as two) and
`'1'` otherwise; an empty list gives null. Confirmed by
`pnpm --filter @odudu/protocol-oidc exec vitest run acr`.
