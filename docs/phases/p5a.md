# P5a — the MCP server, first release

The running record of what building the phase found. The argument is in
[the spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-05-p5a-mcp-server-design.md) and
[the plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-11-05-p5a-mcp-server.md).

## The spike (Increment 0), 2026-11-05

Three claims the plan rested on were about libraries and about this
repository's token exchange. Each was run, not read.

### The SDK serves both eras and mounts on Fastify

verified: `npm view @modelcontextprotocol/server version time` — 2.4.0,
published 2026-10-23. `@modelcontextprotocol/node` 2.1.2 and
`@modelcontextprotocol/fastify` 2.0.1 exist and are older than the 24-hour
release-age floor. The Inspector's latest (2.14.0) was ten hours old, so the
version the floor allows is 2.13.0.

- `createMcpHandler(factory, { legacy })` from `@modelcontextprotocol/server`
  serves 2026-07-28, and by default 2025-11-25 `initialize` traffic **without
  sessions** (`legacy: 'stateless'`). `legacy: 'reject'` answers a 2025 request
  400 `-32022` with `data.supported: ["2026-07-28"]`. A session-keeping legacy
  mode is not provided. The spike did not test 2025-06-18.
- It mounts on plain Fastify 5 at `/tenants/:tenant/mcp`:
  `reply.hijack()` then `toNodeHandler(handler)(req.raw, reply.raw, req.body)`.
  The factory runs per HTTP request (about three times per legacy tool call),
  so per-tenant state comes from `ctx.requestInfo` or a cache.
- `@modelcontextprotocol/fastify` is a thin layer of Host and Origin hooks.
  Its lists are static, but a hook built inside the server's own `onRequest`
  from the tenant's accepted hosts works. The Origin check compares hostname
  only and lets a request with no Origin through. GET and DELETE answer 405.
- The handler verifies no token. A principal is passed in as
  `req.raw.auth = { token, clientId, scopes, resource }` and reaches tool
  handlers as `ctx.http.authInfo`. The 401 and its `WWW-Authenticate`
  challenge are Odudu's own `onRequest` work.
- The Inspector CLI (`--cli`, `--protocol-era modern`) runs headless with
  `--header 'Authorization: Bearer …'` and exits non-zero on failure. A
  headless full OAuth flow was not run; `--stored-auth-only` exits 3 with
  `auth_required` on a 401.

### The exchange works in-process, with three changes

verified by a scratch integration test (deleted) through the real `/token` and
the admin fixture:

- Delegation (an `actor_token`) mints `sub = owner`, a narrowed `scope`,
  `aud = [ADMIN_API_AUDIENCE, issuer]` and `act = { sub: <actor token's
subject> }`, with no `may_act` anywhere. Impersonation mints no `act`.
- **The admin API ignores `scope` and `act`.** A token narrowed to `openid`
  listed clients (`authenticate-admin.ts` checks issuer, audience, `typ`,
  grant, session, client and subject only). The plan's increment 5 owns this.
- **A public client with the exchange grant reaches it at `/token`** with any
  valid actor token, since `/token` needs no secret for a public client, and
  the actor token is not bound to the requesting client. Another client's
  `client_credentials` token worked as actor.
- `issueTokens` is not exported and always authenticates the client; the inner
  functions take an already-resolved client but are not exported either.

Consequences written into the plan: an in-process entry point that sets `act`
to the agent client directly (no actor token, no `/token` request); a refusal
of the exchange for public clients and a binding of an actor token to the
requesting client, both as settings an operator controls.

### What the target clients do (research; official docs unless marked)

- **Claude (claude.ai, Desktop connectors):** speaks the `initialize` era
  (2026-07-28 "rolling out", secondary). Client id: CIMD preferred (needs
  `client_id_metadata_document_supported: true` and `none` in
  `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`, else DCR), DCR, or a pasted client
  id. Redirect `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` (may become
  `claude.com`). Needs a public HTTPS URL: Anthropic's servers make the calls.
  No client-credentials extension. Requires a 401 with `resource_metadata`, a
  PRM `resource` equal to the MCP URL, form-encoded `/token`, S256 and rotating
  refresh tokens for public clients; uses the first `authorization_servers`
  entry; appends `offline_access` when the AS lists it.
- **Claude Code:** `http://localhost` works; CIMD document at
  `https://claude.ai/oauth/claude-code-client-metadata` with redirect URIs
  `http://localhost/callback` and `http://127.0.0.1/callback` (any port); a
  static `--client-id` and DCR also work; the v2 runtime can speak 2026-07-28.
- **Cursor:** DCR as a public client or a static `auth.CLIENT_ID`; no CIMD;
  redirects `http://localhost:8787/callback` and
  `https://www.cursor.com/agents/mcp/oauth/callback` (no `cursor://` found);
  `http://localhost` works; protocol revision unpublished.
- **Unknown, to capture by transcript:** the exact DCR bodies, any `iss`
  validation, Cursor's revision, hosted Claude's CIMD URL path.

Gate result: no target client needs a revision the SDK does not serve, so the
phase continues. Residual risk: the SDK source names only 2025-11-25 and
2026-07-28; the hand run records what each client negotiates.

## The built-in client

`odudu-mcp` is provisioned with every tenant and backfilled by migration 0114;
`clients.builtin_mcp` marks it, once a tenant. Its posture stays amendable: an
administrator may disable it (the off switch), change its name or lifetimes, even
its redirect URIs. Only deletion is refused, because its id is reserved and a
deleted client could not be created again, and only the marker is not
amendable. `odudu-admin` is guarded harder because every administrator depends
on it; nothing depends on `odudu-mcp`.

The export document carries no marker field. An import derives the marker from
the id, which is safe because the import refuses an `odudu-mcp` client that is
not public, has a `client_credentials` grant, or registers anything but the bare
`http://127.0.0.1` and `http://[::1]`: the shape that gets any-port loopback
matching cannot be smuggled in under that id. The replacement of the provisioned
row by the document's happens in the import's one transaction. Its row ids come
from `gen_random_uuid()` in the migration, not `newId()` (v7); lists key on the
id as a total order and `isUuid` accepts any version, so nothing assumes v7.

## Client ID metadata documents

A URL `client_id` becomes a client row, not a transient object: the usecases
after `/authorize` (consent, token, userinfo, introspection) all read clients
by `client_id` from `clients`, and a second path for a client that is not there
would have touched each of them. So `persistCimdClient` upserts the row, from
the validated projection, every time `/authorize` resolves the document; a
no-store document is fetched every time and never cached.

- **Off is unknown.** With `cimd_enabled` off, `/authorize` answers a URL id,
  including one with a stored row, byte for byte as it answers an unknown id,
  and `/token` refuses a stored row's client as `invalid_client`. A client
  registered by hand under a URL id is served whatever the setting says.
- **A failed fetch refuses the client**, even with a stored row, so a redirect
  address the owner has withdrawn does not keep working while their server is
  down.
- **Bounds.** At most 1,000 per tenant (a lock per tenant makes the check
  hold under concurrency); at the ceiling a new client evicts the least recently
  used one with no consent, no usable refresh token and no live code, else is
  refused, because resolving a document needs no sign-in; last use written at most once a day, and `reap`
  deletes a client unused for thirty days unless a refresh token of it can
  still be used. An administrator's `enabled = false` is never undone by a
  resolution.
- **Review round.** A client's `jwks_uri` is fetched public-only whatever
  `ODUDU_ALLOW_PRIVATE_CLIENT_URLS` says; a `private_key_jwt` document needs a
  non-empty key set or a `jwks_uri`; the cache keeps the later fetch (stamped
  with when the fetch began); eviction and `reap` skip disabled clients (evict)
  and count a refresh token only while its grant is unrevoked and it has not
  lapsed by more than an access token's life; a late DNS answer sends nothing;
  roles of an omitted cimd client are left out of the export (and out of its
  size bound); `reap` also spares disabled clients; the userinfo encryption
  fetch is public-only for cimd clients. Every `clientKeySet.fetch` caller is
  the private_key_jwt authentication (/token, /introspect, /revoke) and that one.
- **Left for a policy.** The client has no audience and no MCP scope; both
  arrive with the MCP registration policy. Turning the setting off does not
  disable stored rows: `/authorize` and `/token` refuse them by reading the
  setting, so a later control for the setting changes nothing else.
- **The setting reached the admin API with its column**, because tenant
  settings, their export and `seed tenant --set` are one map. The console
  control is still to come (`PLACED_ELSEWHERE` in the settings page names it).
