# A subject's required actions: read and set

This page covers `GET /subjects/:id/required-actions` and `PUT /subjects/:id/required-actions`.

The read requires `view-users`, the write `manage-users`. Sets a subject's
required actions wholesale — an action left out of the list is one the
caller clears, not one left alone.

**`If-Match` is mandatory here, not optional.** This route replaces an
authorization-bearing list whole, so a stale write reinstates exactly what
another administrator has just removed; the header comes from the matching
`GET`, which answers an `ETag` over the same list. Absent, the request is
refused with `428 Precondition Required` and nothing is changed; stale,
with `412`. The list is read under the same lock the replacement runs
under, so two callers sent at once are serialised — the second sees what
the first wrote rather than matching the same pre-write state.

On `grace`, who was created through `POST /subjects` and so carries
`update-password` and nothing else. The read first, for the `ETag` the write
needs:

```bash
curl -sS -D - \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/admin/tenants/demo/subjects/01a0d7ef-2be7-7a2e-bbc5-4646e22c3169/required-actions
```

```

```

The same write twice: without the header, then with it.

```bash
curl -sS -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actions": ["configure-totp"]}' \
  http://localhost:3000/admin/tenants/demo/subjects/01a0d7ef-2be7-7a2e-bbc5-4646e22c3169/required-actions

curl -sS -D - -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'If-Match: "b6a877586a3e8e6eec8a74fd3ec35d6463a777d4a4f379aa095140acd8edcc10"' \
  -d '{"actions": ["configure-totp"]}' \
  http://localhost:3000/admin/tenants/demo/subjects/01a0d7ef-2be7-7a2e-bbc5-4646e22c3169/required-actions
```

The reply to the second is the set as it now stands — `update-password` is
gone, cleared by being left out — and a fresh `ETag` for the next write:

```

Replaying the first `ETag`, now one generation stale, changes nothing:

```bash
curl -sS -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H 'If-Match: "b6a877586a3e8e6eec8a74fd3ec35d6463a777d4a4f379aa095140acd8edcc10"' \

  http://localhost:3000/admin/tenants/demo/subjects/01a0d7ef-2be7-7a2e-bbc5-4646e22c3169/required-actions
```

```
