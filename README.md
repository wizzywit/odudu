# Odudu

*Odudu* — power, authority. Ibibio, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.

An identity and access management platform: an OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect
provider with Keycloak feature parity, plus a first-class agent identity
layer for delegated authority, guardrails, and machine-readable
administration.

Self-hostable as one container plus PostgreSQL.

## Status

Design complete. Implementation begins at P0.

## Why not Keycloak

Keycloak has no notion of an agent as an identity. A service account is
shared, coarse, and permanent; there is no way to say "this agent, acting
for this person, with strictly less authority than they have, for the next
ten minutes, within this budget, revocable independently."

Odudu makes that the centre of the design rather than an afterthought, and
does it with standard mechanisms — RFC 8693 token exchange, `act` and
`may_act` claims, CIBA for out-of-band approval — so relying parties need
no special knowledge.
