_Odudu_ — power, authority. Ibibio, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.

An identity and access management platform: an OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect
provider with Keycloak feature parity, plus a first-class agent identity
layer for delegated authority, guardrails, and machine-readable
administration.

Self-hostable as one container plus PostgreSQL.

## Status

**P0 (foundation) complete.** No protocol surface yet — P0 built the ground
the rest stands on: the monorepo and its single `pnpm verify` gate,
machine-checked architectural boundaries, the kernel primitives, one ordered
migration timeline with PostgreSQL row-level security, a Fastify server
composed from kernel modules, and a container proven to boot by CI on every
push. P1 begins the OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect core.

- [Design specification](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-odudu-design.md) —
  what this is, and the twelve phases with their exit criteria
- [Architecture decision records](docs/adr/) — the decisions, several with
  dated corrections recording what turned out wrong
- [Decision log](docs/superpowers/p0-decision-log.md) — judgement calls made
  during P0, each with what it would cost if wrong
- [What to do next](docs/NEXT.md) — including what P0 deliberately deferred

## Running it

Requires Node 24, pnpm and Docker. `pnpm install` first.

Two credential files, each read by a different thing, neither committed:

```bash
cp infra/docker/.env.example infra/docker/.env   # the compose stack
cp .env.example .env                             # the server, run on your host
```

Neither is created for you: the stack refuses to start without its own
(ADR 0015), so nothing can be lifted and run by accident.

**Everything in Docker** — server and Postgres, closest to how it deploys:

```bash
cd infra/docker && docker compose up --build
curl http://localhost:3000/health/ready
```

**Postgres in Docker, server on your host** — the actual development loop,
with watch mode:

```bash
cd infra/docker && docker compose up -d postgres
cd ../.. && pnpm --filter @odudu/server dev
curl http://localhost:3000/health/ready
```

Both print `{"status":"ok","checks":{"database":"ok"}}`. The server applies
migrations on boot, so there is no separate migrate step.

Do not run both at once: each wants port 3000. Postgres is published on
**5442**, not 5432, because a host commonly already has one there.

**Check the whole thing works**, including that row-level security is
genuinely enforced in the container:

```bash
./infra/docker/smoke.sh
```

Enable the repo's git hooks once per clone — they reject commit messages
carrying tool-attribution trailers, which CI also enforces:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

**The gate** everything must pass — formatting, types, lint, architectural
boundaries, and tests including container-backed integration ones. Needs
Docker running:

```bash
pnpm verify
```

## Why not Keycloak

Keycloak has no notion of an agent as an identity. A service account is
shared, coarse, and permanent; there is no way to say "this agent, acting
for this person, with strictly less authority than they have, for the next
ten minutes, within this budget, revocable independently."

Odudu makes that the centre of the design rather than an afterthought, and
does it with standard mechanisms — RFC 8693 token exchange, `act` and
`may_act` claims, CIBA for out-of-band approval — so relying parties need
no special knowledge.

## License

[Apache-2.0](LICENSE). The patent grant is deliberate: identity
infrastructure is exactly the kind of thing an organisation's legal team
asks about before adopting.
